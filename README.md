# lispmath
A math function-pack for lisp.

#### Have you ever wanted a Catalan number generator for your lisp?
Well, this has that, and basically, everything but the kitchen sink!

And we have a *lot* of things in the pack, including:
<ul type="">
  <li>Trigonometry functions!</li>
  <li>Catalan number generators!</li>
  <li>And <strong>much, much more!</strong></li>
 </ul>
 
 This is all open-source, so come and add your own things!

 ## Awesome notes
This comes with a **create-p** macro to create your own predicates!<br/>
We love new people – come on in and join the fun!
